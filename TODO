	dreamlet: dream for single cell analysis
		weight by both reads and cell number
		like muscat, except per-sample weights are used by voomWithDreamWeights
			instead of lmFit: https://github.com/HelenaLC/muscat/blob/c93966305b1317b0caf5c6eb374826d6432b4a0a/R/utils-pbDS.R#L104
		Should I weight voom or the lmFit step?

dreamlet = function(snObj, form){

	# for each cell type
	fitList = lapply( assays(snObj), function(cellType){
		
		# get data for this cell type
		geneExpr = assay(snObj, cellType)

		# get samples with enough cells
		# filter genes
		geneExpr = filterByExpr(geneExpr)

		# per sample weights
		w = weights by cell types

		# need to adapt voomByDreamWeights to allow per sample weights
		vobj = voomByDreamWeights( geneExpr, form, info, weights=w)

		# need to adapt dream to allow per sample weights
		fit = dream(vobj, form, info, weights=w)

		# finish eBayes
		# only use trend if precion weights are not available
		fit = eBayes(fit, robust, trend)

		# return full results like muscat does
		fit
	})

	# Add ashr on the results of topTable

	fitList
}






DONE!

	info must be casted to a data.frame since DataFrame is not handled correctly
		and gives error:
		Error in if (inherits(possibleError, "error") && grep("the fixed-effects model matrix is column rank deficient",  : 
	  missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

# November 2, 2020
- integrate voomWithQualityWeights() with voomWithDreamWeights
	o Need to convert lm.fit() calls to dream()
	o Need to dream() to return hatvalues



recommend placing a check to verify if the names in the info matrix, match with the names used in the formula and return an error if not




library(BiocParallel)

# globally specify that all multithreading using bpiterate from BiocParallel
# should use 8 cores
register(SnowParam(8))

# By default it is set to the max number of CPUs
# If you have a very long interactive session, this can crash and you get the error you see

Alternatively, you can specify and restart the parallel backend every function call

Check if there is variation in each gene.  
	else throw error


# June 16, 2016
Improve warnings in fitVarPart and fitExtractVarPart to show which gene give a warning

# April 16, 2016
 Make correlation matrix and linear mixed model equantions in vignette
 the same as in supplement.  The vignette examples are wrong

Add canCorPairs to the vignette


# Feb 18, 2015
add e_{i,k} in ICC correlation equation


# December 14, 2015

# Add strong warning to fitVarPartModel() that estimates memory usage.  In vignette, users should be discoraged from using this interface.

# use refit() to fit the model for each gene:
#  cannot do this because refit() doesn't accept new weights

# DE test: show increased power when correlation is overestimated, and decrease false positive rate when correlation is underestimated.  (order is correct?)  





# adjust doesn't work with varying coefficient model, but it throwings an error now

# run simulations with varying coefficient model
