\arguments{
\item{exprObj}{matrix of expression data (g genes x n samples), or \code{ExpressionSet}, or \code{EList} returned by \code{voom()} from the \code{limma} package}

\item{formula}{specifies variables for the linear (mixed) model.  Must only specify covariates, since the rows of exprObj are automatically used a a response. e.g.: \code{~ a + b + (1|c)}}

\item{data}{\code{data.frame} with columns corresponding to formula}

\item{REML}{use restricted maximum likelihood to fit linear mixed model. default is FALSE.  Strongly discourage against changing this option, but here for compatibility.}

\item{useWeights}{if TRUE, analysis uses heteroskedastic error estimates from \code{voom()}.  Value is ignored unless exprObj is an \code{EList} from \code{voom()} or \code{weightsMatrix} is specified}

\item{weightsMatrix}{matrix the same dimension as exprObj with observation-level weights from \code{voom()}.  Used only if useWeights is TRUE}

\item{showWarnings}{show warnings about model fit (default TRUE)}

\item{colinearityCutoff}{cutoff used to determine if model is computationally singular}

\item{control}{control settings for \code{lmer()}}

\item{nsim}{number of bootstrap datasets}

\item{...}{Additional arguments for \code{lmer()} or l\code{m()}}
}
\value{
\code{list()} of where each entry is the result for a gene.  Each entry is a matrix of the 95\% confidence interval of the variance fraction for each variable

\description{
Fit linear mixed model to estimate contribution of multiple sources of variation while simultaneously correcting for all other variables. Then perform parametric bootstrap sampling to get a 95\% confidence intervals for each variable for each gene.
}
\details{
A linear mixed model is fit for each gene, and \code{bootMer()} is used to generate parametric bootstrap confidence intervals.  \code{use.u=TRUE} is used so that the \deqn{\hat{u}} values from the random effects are used as estimated and are not re-sampled.  This gives confidence intervals as if additional data were generated from these same current samples.  Conversely, \code{use.u=FALSE} assumes that  this dataset is a sample from a larger population.   Thus it simulates \deqn{\hat{u}} based on the estimated variance parameter.  This approach gives confidence intervals as if additional data were collected from the larger population from which this dataset is sampled.  Overall, \code{use.u=TRUE} gives smaller confidence intervals that are appropriate in this case.

# load library
# library(variancePartition)

# optional step to run analysis in parallel on multicore machines
# Here, we used 4 threads
library(doParallel)
cl <- makeCluster(4)
registerDoParallel(cl)
# or by using the doSNOW package

# load simulated data:
# geneExpr: matrix of gene expression values
# info: information/metadata about each sample
data(varPartData)

# Specify variables to consider
# Age is continuous so we model it as a fixed effect
# Individual and Tissue are both categorical, so we model them as random effects
form <- ~ Age + (1|Individual) + (1|Tissue) 

# Compute bootstrap confidence intervals for each variable for each gene
resCI <- varPartConfInf( geneExpr[1:5,], form, info, nsim=100 )
